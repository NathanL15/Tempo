## Inspiration
Running: freedom and ecstasy for some, and a daunting task for many. It has been a staple in cardiovascular health since the dawn of time. While running has been proven to significantly improve both physical and mental health, why do so few people engage in itâ€”even gym-goers? Running is often seen as repetitive, boring, and difficult to keep pace with, which can lead to a lack of motivation. This inspired us to create Tempo, a web app that generates a playlist based on your running goals.

## What it does
Tempo is a web app that considers your goal running distance, time, and height to calculate your optimal running stride pace. It then curates a unique playlist based on your preferred songs or chosen genre, matching the tempo to your stride pace. This allows runners to subconsciously maintain their pace throughout their entire run, without needing to consult or adjust any metrics.

## How we built it
Tempo was built using Spotify's API to build playlists and find songs. It is run on a backend server using Node.js and Express.js, and the frontend was built using React.js and regular CSS.
